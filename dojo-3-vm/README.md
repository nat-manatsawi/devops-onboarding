# Dojo 3

You need to have already finished with success the Dojo 1 and 2 to do this one.

## Part 1: discover multiple GNU / Linux distribution

Install Ubuntu and Fedora in Virtualbox. Optional: also install Alpine.
You should have SSH access to the machine and the machine should have a valid Network connection.

Goal:
  - be familliar with other operating system
  - unsterdand main different (apt-get, apt, yum...)


## Part 2: how to be agnostic from the operating system

Create a **bash** script that be able to install Nginx and each of the distribution that we have saw during the part 1.
If already installed, update it to the latest version. Your script should be able to detect what kind of Linux you use.
